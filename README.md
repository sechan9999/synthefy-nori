Nori is a tabular foundation model for **regression**
via in-context learning (ICL). Given a few labeled rows as context, it predicts on
new query rows in a single forward pass, with no task-specific training or fine-tuning.
The model is trained entirely on synthetic data.

This repository contains the public training, inference, evaluation, and Hugging
Face checkpoint tooling.

Three sizes ship, and `model=` is required — there is no default:
**`"nori-6m"`** (the base), **`"nori-30m"`**, and **`"nori-100m"`** (the largest).
See [Benchmarks](#benchmarks) for how to evaluate any of them on the public suites.

## Use it from your AI coding assistant

Paste this into Claude Code, Cursor, or any AI coding assistant and it will wire
Nori into your own project:

````text
Look at my code/task/report here and figure out where Nori would best fit — it's
Synthefy's tabular foundation model, a drop-in scikit-learn estimator that predicts
a continuous target by in-context learning: no training loop, no hyperparameters,
and it automatically uses CUDA or Apple MPS when available (CPU otherwise).

1. Install it with this project's package manager
   (e.g. `uv add synthefy-nori`, or `pip install -U synthefy-nori`).

2. Use it wherever a tabular regression / prediction step fits:

   ```python
   from synthefy_nori import NoriRegressor

   reg = NoriRegressor(model="nori-6m")   # or "nori-30m" / "nori-100m" for the larger sizes
   reg.fit(X_train, y_train)              # stores your rows as context — no training happens
   y_pred = reg.predict(X_test)           # point predictions (predictive-distribution mean)

   # Prediction intervals come free — no conformal/quantile add-ons:
   lo, mid, hi = reg.predict(X_test, output_type="quantiles", quantiles=[0.1, 0.5, 0.9])
   ```

X may be a numeric list/array, or a pandas DataFrame containing numeric and
categorical columns; name free-text columns with `text_columns=[...]`. DataFrame
category mappings are fitted on training rows and replayed on query rows. Leave
missing values as NaN and do not scale. y is a finite continuous target. If I
already have a model, wire Nori up alongside it on the same train/test split and
metric so I can compare them. If the best place to plug Nori in isn't obvious,
show me where you'd put it and confirm with me before making changes.

Going deeper: synthefy-nori ships a ready-made nori-regression skill for AI coding
assistants with vetted recipes — calibrated prediction intervals, honest baseline
comparison under fixed CV, SHAP/PDP interpretability, and leak-safe one-step
time-series forecasting. Read and follow it if relevant:

## Install

This source tree builds two independently versioned distributions with disjoint
namespaces:

| Use case | Install | Public entry point |
|---|---|---|
| Hosted regression | `pip install synthefy` | `SynthefyNoriClient(mode="remote", model=...)` |
| SageMaker regression | `pip install "synthefy[aws]"` | `SynthefyNoriClient(mode="sagemaker", model=..., endpoint_name=...)` |
| Local regression | `pip install synthefy-nori` | `NoriRegressor(model=...)` or `SynthefyNoriClient(mode="local", model=...)` |
| Hosted forecasting | `pip install "synthefy[forecasting]"` | `synthefy.nori_ts.NoriTSForecaster(mode="remote", model=...)` |
| Local forecasting | `pip install "synthefy-nori[forecasting]"` | `synthefy.nori_ts.NoriTSForecaster(mode="local", model=...)` |

Hosted users receive the lightweight client and workflow code without Torch or
model weights. Local users install `synthefy-nori`, which supplies the model
runtime and depends on the lightweight `synthefy` package. The dependency never
points in the other direction.

For local regression:

```bash
pip install synthefy-nori
```

For hosted regression, the client reads `SYNTHEFY_NORI_API_KEY` unless
`api_key=` is supplied:

```bash
pip install synthefy
export SYNTHEFY_NORI_API_KEY="<your key>"
```

```python
from synthefy import SynthefyNoriClient

client = SynthefyNoriClient(mode="remote", model="nori-30m")
predictions = client.predict([[0.0], [1.0]], [0.0, 1.0], [[0.5]])
client.close()
```

Execution modes are limited to `remote`, `sagemaker`, and `local`; `auto` is
not supported. The Nori client retains `remote` when `mode=` is omitted for
backwards compatibility, while the forecaster requires an explicit mode. Both
require an explicit `model=`; there is no default model.

Optional heavyweight extras:

```bash
pip install "synthefy-nori[train]"   # training-only deps (wandb, xgboost)
pip install "synthefy-nori[eval]"    # evaluation-only deps (matplotlib, openml)
```

### Develop from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Synthefy/synthefy-nori
cd synthefy-nori
uv sync --extra dev
```

`uv sync` installs `torch` from PyPI, whose default wheel is a **CUDA 12.8**
build on Linux (CPU on Windows) — enough to reproduce the benchmarks without a
manual step. The package pins **no** torch index and supports the tested
`torch>=2.8,<2.14` range, so it composes cleanly as a git/path dependency: a
consumer picks its own torch build with no index conflict. To use a different
CUDA build, add your own `[[tool.uv.index]]` + `[tool.uv.sources]` in *your*
project — e.g. `pytorch-cu130` (needs torch >= 2.9) or `pytorch-cu132` (needs
torch >= 2.12), both requiring Python >= 3.10 since torch dropped 3.9 in 2.9.

For a one-off CUDA 13.0 environment in this checkout:

```bash
nori_cuda_venv="$(mktemp -d)"
uv venv --python 3.11 "$nori_cuda_venv"
uv pip install --python "$nori_cuda_venv/bin/python" --no-config \
  "torch>=2.9,<2.14" --torch-backend=cu130
uv pip install --python "$nori_cuda_venv/bin/python" --no-config -e ".[dev]"
"$nori_cuda_venv/bin/python" -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__, torch.version.cuda)"
```

The separate environment avoids mixing CUDA 12 and CUDA 13 NVIDIA packages in
the benchmark `.venv`; `--no-config` bypasses this checkout's deliberate
`torch<2.9` development constraint for those commands. The repo-local
`constraint-dependencies` that holds the normal lock is not read by consumers.

Nori excludes cuDNN from PyTorch SDPA dispatch by default because cuDNN attention
has been unreliable on the model's dynamic tabular shapes and small attention
heads. The restriction is scoped to Nori's attention call and leaves global
PyTorch backend settings untouched. Set `SYNTHEFY_NORI_ALLOW_CUDNN_SDP=1` before
importing Nori to opt back into PyTorch's default backend selection.
The Muon optimizer used in training prefers `torch.optim.Muon`; if your PyTorch
lacks it, the package automatically falls back to a built-in implementation.

## Quickstart

Pretrained weights are hosted on the Hugging Face Hub, one repo per size:
[`Synthefy/Nori`](https://huggingface.co/Synthefy/Nori) (`nori-6m`),
[`Synthefy/Nori-30M`](https://huggingface.co/Synthefy/Nori-30M) (`nori-30m`) and
[`Synthefy/Nori-100M`](https://huggingface.co/Synthefy/Nori-100M) (`nori-100m`).
The first call downloads and caches the checkpoint automatically, so a complete
working example is just:

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from synthefy_nori import NoriRegressor

X, y = load_diabetes(return_X_y=True)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

model = NoriRegressor(model="nori-30m")    # downloads weights from the HF Hub on first use
model.fit(X_train, y_train)           # "fit" just stores the labeled rows as context
pred = model.predict(X_test)          # predictions in a single forward pass, no training
```

With ``device=None`` (the default), it prefers CUDA, then Apple MPS, and otherwise
uses CPU. After ``fit``, ``model.device_`` records the selected device; named text
encoders use that same device. A one-shot helper skips the object entirely:

```python
from synthefy_nori import predict
pred = predict(X_train, y_train, X_test, task="regression", model="nori-30m")
```

### DataFrame features: numeric, categorical, and text

`NoriRegressor` accepts raw pandas DataFrames. By default,
`categorical_columns="auto"` encodes remaining non-numeric columns without
loading the optional text model. Name categoricals explicitly when you want a
strict schema, and name free text separately. The mixed example below requires
`pip install "synthefy-nori[text]"`:

```python
import pandas as pd
from synthefy_nori import NoriRegressor

X_train = pd.DataFrame({
    "monthly_spend": [29.0, 85.0, 42.0],
    "plan": ["free", "pro", "free"],
    "ticket_description": ["login failed", "invoice question", "slow dashboard"],
})
X_test = pd.DataFrame({
    "ticket_description": ["cannot sign in"],  # order may differ
    "plan": ["enterprise"],                    # unseen -> fitted "other" code
    "monthly_spend": [110.0],
})

reg = NoriRegressor(
    model="nori-30m",
    categorical_columns=["plan"],
    text_columns=["ticket_description"],
).fit(X_train, [3.0, 1.0, 4.0])
prediction = reg.predict(X_test)
```

The three categorical modes are:

- `"auto"` (default): encode remaining non-numeric, non-text columns;
- a sequence such as `["plan"]`: encode exactly those columns and reject other
  undeclared strings;
- `None`: disable categorical inference and require remaining columns to be numeric.

Ordinal mappings and text SVD are fitted on `X_train` only. Missing categorical
values remain `NaN`; rare and unseen values use one bounded `other` code.
Automatically inferred columns above `max_categorical_cardinality=100` raise an
ambiguity error instead of being silently dropped or embedded. Explicitly name
such a column as categorical (top-K plus `other`), text, or encode/remove it.
Numeric lists/arrays remain positional and must already be numeric.

`categorical_columns` describes feature columns in `X`. In contrast,
`categorical_levels` below describes the allowed numeric values of the target
`y`; it never declares feature columns. See
[DataFrame preprocessing](docs/inference.md#dataframe-features-numeric-categorical-and-text).

To run from your own checkpoint instead of the Hub default, pass a path:

```python
model = NoriRegressor(model_path="path/to/checkpoint.pt")
```

`predict` follows the `TabPFNRegressor.predict` contract: pass
`output_type="mean"` (default), `"median"`, or `"mode"` to choose the point
estimate drawn from the model's predictive distribution.

### Probabilistic output (quantiles)

The default checkpoint has a 999-quantile pinball head, so the full predictive
distribution is available — not just a point estimate. Use
`output_type="quantiles"` for specific levels, or `output_type="full"` for the
whole quantile bank (handy for CRPS / interval scoring, calibration, and
prediction intervals):

```python
model = NoriRegressor(model="nori-30m").fit(X_train, y_train)

# Quantiles at chosen levels -> shape (n_levels, n_samples)
q10, q50, q90 = model.predict(X_test, output_type="quantiles",
                              quantiles=[0.1, 0.5, 0.9])

# Full distribution as a per-row quantile function
dist = model.predict(X_test, output_type="full")
dist["quantiles"]  # (n_samples, K) ascending quantile values, K = 999
dist["taus"]       # (K,) quantile levels, evenly spaced in (0, 1)
dist["mean"]       # (n_samples,) distribution mean (== output_type="mean")
```

Quantiles are returned in original-`y` units and sorted to a valid (monotone)
quantile function per row. `quantiles`/`full` require the default pinball
checkpoint; a `bar_distribution` checkpoint raises `NotImplementedError`.

### Categorical / ordinal targets

If the target only takes a few discrete values (ratings, counts, quality
scores), pass `discretize=` and predictions are mapped onto the levels seen in
`fit`'s `y` — `"map-cell"` (the mode of the induced discrete posterior) is
best for accuracy, `"median-cell"` is the MAE-optimal alternative,
`"snap-mean"`/`"snap-median"` snap the point estimate. Snapping is strictly
opt-in — the default `predict()` always returns the continuous point estimate —
and for R²-scored tasks that default is what you want. See
[docs/inference.md](docs/inference.md#categorical--ordinal-targets-discretize--categorical_levels).

```python
labels = model.predict(X_test, discretize="map-cell")  # values from y_train's lattice
```

Runnable example: [`examples/inference_regression.py`](examples/inference_regression.py).
More detail in [docs/inference.md](docs/inference.md).

## Authentication (optional)

The default checkpoint at
[`Synthefy/Nori`](https://huggingface.co/Synthefy/Nori)
is **public**: the first inference call downloads and caches it automatically,
with no token and no access request.

A Hugging Face token is only worth setting if you hit anonymous download rate
limits, or if you point the package at a private/gated checkpoint of your own.
Provide one in any of these ways:

```bash
# Option A: env var (one-shot)
export HF_TOKEN=hf_xxxxxxxx

# Option B: persist via the HF CLI (huggingface-hub >= 1.0)
hf auth login
```

```python
# Option C: pass explicitly in code
from synthefy_nori import NoriRegressor
model = NoriRegressor(token="hf_xxxxxxxx", model="nori-30m")
```

Get a token at <https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens> (read scope is
sufficient). If you supply a local `model_path=` instead, no network access is
needed at all.

## How it works

### Architecture

Nori is a **FeaturesTransformer** — one architecture shipped at three sizes (`nori-6m`,
`nori-30m`, `nori-100m`), differing in width and depth — that alternates
two kinds of attention:

- **Feature attention** learns relationships between columns.
- **Sample attention** learns relationships between rows (context and query).
- **In-context learning**: predictions condition on labeled context rows, with no
  gradient updates at inference.

Key config: 16 transformer layers, embed_dim 128, hidden 384, 2 heads, the
**v2-lite** block (SwiGLU + RMSNorm + pre-norm), features grouped in pairs
(`features_per_group=2`), with **column-specific y-aware** feature attention.
Features are encoded with RBF embeddings; missing values are handled natively
via learned mask embeddings.

### Synthetic data

The model never sees real data during training. Its capability comes from a diverse
synthetic data generator covering real-world tabular regimes:

- **Structural Causal Models (SCM)**: hierarchical DAGs with 8 edge-function types
  (MLP, decision tree, piecewise-linear, polynomial, periodic, RBF, log/exp, conv1d).
- **Regression priors**: 9 target families (dense/sparse linear, GAM, interactions,
  random MLP, random tree, radial/RBF, Fourier features, chained trigonometric).
- **Realism augmentations**: discretized features, noise features, correlated blocks,
  structural missingness, label noise.
- **Learnability filter**: an ExtraTrees signal-quality filter rejects unlearnable
  datasets so training compute is spent on learnable tasks.

See [docs/training.md](docs/training.md) for the full recipe.

## Interpretability

Explain Nori's predictions with **SHAP / Shapley values**, feature interactions,
partial dependence / ICE, and sequential feature selection — see which features
drive a prediction, detect interactions, and debug unexpected outputs. Because
`NoriRegressor` is a scikit-learn estimator, it works directly with
[shapiq](https://github.com/mmschlk/shapiq) (a fast SHAP implementation with
native Shapley-interaction support) and the sklearn interpretability ecosystem —
no adapters needed beyond the thin convenience wrappers in
`synthefy_nori.interpretability`.

```bash
pip install "synthefy-nori[interpretability]"
```

```python
from synthefy_nori import NoriRegressor
from synthefy_nori.interpretability.shapiq import get_nori_imputation_explainer

model = NoriRegressor(model="nori-30m").fit(X_train, y_train)
explainer = get_nori_imputation_explainer(model, X_train)   # imputation-based, model-agnostic
sv = explainer.explain(X_test[:1], budget=128)              # SHAP/Shapley values for one prediction
sv.plot_waterfall()                                         # additive contribution waterfall
```

Also available: `interpretability.pdp.partial_dependence_plots` (global feature
effects) and `interpretability.feature_selection.feature_selection`. Regression
only. Runnable example:
[`examples/interpretability_regression.py`](examples/interpretability_regression.py);
full guide in [docs/interpretability.md](docs/interpretability.md).

### SHAPIQ explanation speed

SHAPIQ's baseline imputer stacks every coalition of an explanation into a single
batched `model.predict` call, so on Nori the per-explanation wall-clock is
dominated by one forward pass — encoding the fixed training context — and is
essentially **flat in the coalition budget**. On a single H200 (superconductivity,
top-12 features, 1500 context rows, mean over 5 test rows), order-1 Shapley values
(`index="SV"`) cost ~2.2–2.3 s/explanation and order-2 pairwise interactions
(`max_order=2`, k-SII) ~1.3–1.5 s/explanation across budgets of 32–512, both
hovering near the ~1.9 s single-batched-predict floor. The takeaway: you can raise
`budget` for far more accurate attributions at near-zero extra cost, and
interaction order barely changes runtime.

Reproduce (prints the results table and writes `benchmarks/plots/shapiq_speed.png`):
`uv run python benchmarks/bench_shapiq_speed.py`

### SHAP explanation speed

The classic `shap` library also works on Nori via a `model.predict` callable. The
benchmark below measures per-row explanation time as the evaluation budget grows on
a 12-feature subset of `superconductivity` (context = 1500 rows, 5 test rows, H200).
Because every coalition is one Nori forward pass, `shap.KernelExplainer` stays
roughly flat (~3.0–3.7 s/row from nsamples 32 to 256, ~6.2 s/row at 512) while
`shap.PermutationExplainer` scales near-linearly with `max_evals`, climbing from
~5 s/row to ~28 s/row at 512. For comparison, shapiq's imputation explainer
(`index="SV"`) computes the same single-feature Shapley values in ~0.9–1.6 s/row
regardless of budget — roughly 2–4× faster than KernelExplainer and up to ~20×
faster than PermutationExplainer at high budgets.

Reproduce (prints the results table and writes `benchmarks/plots/shap_speed.png`):
`uv run python benchmarks/bench_shap_speed.py`

## Benchmarks

Mean and median R² across 95 public regression tasks from three suites, for all three
sizes. Accuracy increases with size on every suite, on both statistics:

| Suite | Datasets | Nori-6M · mean / median | Nori-30M · mean / median | Nori-100M · mean / median |
|-------|---------:|:-----------------------:|:------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
| TabArena | 13 | 0.8069 / 0.8772 | 0.8099 / 0.8834 | **0.8118 / 0.8902** |
| TALENT | 71 | 0.7661 / 0.8928 | 0.7671 / 0.8937 | **0.7677 / 0.8938** |
| OpenML | 11 | 0.6362 / 0.5718 | 0.6451 / 0.6212 | **0.6495 / 0.6297** |
| **Overall** | **95** | 0.7567 / 0.8705 | 0.7588 / 0.8752 | **0.7601 / 0.8799** |

How the table was produced, and the two caveats that matter:

- **Same run, same machine, same protocol.** All three columns come from one sweep of
  `synthefy-nori-eval` on H200s, using the released `synthefy-nori[eval]` from PyPI — not a
  local checkout — so the table is reproducible with the command below.
- **`--max-elements-budget 2000000`, not the 8M default.** Nori-100M's key/value cache
  reaches ~179 GiB on the long-context tables and does not fit an 80 GB or a 141 GB GPU at
  the 8M budget. Lowering the budget trims context on the largest tables, which costs a
  little accuracy for every size — so these numbers are comparable **to each other** but are
  *not* comparable to figures produced at a different budget.
- **95 tasks, not 96.** Nori-100M errored on `talent/topo_2_1`, so that dataset is excluded
  from all three columns rather than being scored for some models and not others.

The gaps are real but small — Overall mean moves 0.7567 → 0.7588 → 0.7601 from 6M to 100M.
Pick the size that fits your latency and memory budget; the larger checkpoints need
materially more GPU memory on wide, long-context tables.

Large-context tables (common in TabArena) are the current focus of the
large-table training stages.

> **Thinking** is an inference-time reasoning extension that improves these
> numbers further. Details are forthcoming.

### Running the benchmark

```bash
pip install "synthefy-nori[eval]"

# One size. Repeat --checkpoint (label:path) to score several in one pass, which is how
# the table above was produced. --max-elements-budget must match across sizes for the
# results to be comparable; 2000000 is what the table used.
synthefy-nori-eval --download-benchmarks --openml-reg \
  --checkpoint "nori-100m:$(python -c 'from synthefy_nori.hf import download_checkpoint as d; print(d(model="nori-100m"))')" \
  --max-elements-budget 2000000
```

`--download-benchmarks` writes the TabArena and TALENT CSVs to `cache/` by default;
point them elsewhere with `--tabarena-reg-dir` / `--talent-reg-dir`. Those two flags are
what control dataset location — `--cache-dir` does not, and if the directories are empty
the run scores whatever it can find and still exits 0, so check the
`Loaded N ... datasets` lines before trusting a result.

The first run downloads the pretrained checkpoint from the Hugging Face Hub and
fetches the benchmark datasets into `cache/` as CSVs: TabArena from the
official TabArena curated uploads on OpenML (pinned by OpenML dataset ID, so
the data is immutable), TALENT from OpenML by name, and the OpenML regression
suite on the fly. Dataset membership is pinned by lists shipped with the
package (`synthefy_nori/evaluation/benchmark_lists/`), and train/test
splits use a fixed seed, so the evaluation data is fully deterministic.
Evaluation uses the bundled default inference config
(`default_inference.json`).

The benchmark allows up to 50,000 context rows per dataset (no memory-based row cap). The
inference element budget (`SYNTHEFY_MAX_ELEMENTS_BUDGET`, or `--max-elements-budget`)
defaults to 8M, which targets large GPUs; **the table above used 2M**, because Nori-100M's
key/value cache reaches ~179 GiB on the long-context tables and does not fit an 80 GB or a
141 GB GPU at 8M. Lowering the budget trims context on the largest tables, so results there
sit below a full-context run — more context is genuinely better. Keep the budget identical
across every size you intend to compare. On smaller GPUs also pass `--gpu-mem-gb <GiB>` to
cap context rows by available memory.

The command prints a per-source mean R² summary and
writes per-dataset metrics to `results/eval/all_results.csv`. Expect roughly
30–40 minutes on a single large GPU (`--device cuda:0` by default).

Exact per-dataset R² can move by ±0.001–0.002 across GPU models and
PyTorch/NumPy versions; per-source means should match the table to within
about ±0.003. The TALENT dataset `stock_fardamento02` has a heavy-tailed
target and is the least stable single dataset across environments.

### Script-style harness

An alternative harness drives the public `NoriRegressor` API directly at
[`tests/test_benchmark_performance.py`](tests/test_benchmark_performance.py).
It reads the same CSV caches under `./cache/`; populate them once with
`synthefy-nori-eval --download-benchmarks` (TabArena from the official
TabArena uploads on OpenML pinned by dataset ID, TALENT by name), then run
from the repo root (`uv sync` installs a CUDA 12.8 torch build on Linux by
default, so `uv run` works as-is):

```bash
# OpenML only — works out of the box, no cached CSVs needed
uv run python tests/test_benchmark_performance.py --suites openml

# full sweep over the downloaded caches
uv run python tests/test_benchmark_performance.py --device cuda:0
```

Note the script's OpenML suite uses its own 70/30 split (the packaged CLI uses
80/20), so its OpenML numbers differ slightly from the CLI's.

### RelBench (relational tasks)

Nori also runs on the [RelBench](https://relbench.stanford.edu) leaderboard
tasks via the entity-table tabular protocol (the regime tabular foundation
models like TabPFN are listed under), covering the classification (AUROC) and
regression (MAE) entity tasks across the seven canonical RelBench datasets:

```bash
pip install "synthefy-nori[relbench]"
synthefy-nori-eval --relbench
```

Results (split by task type) and a submission package land in
`results/relbench/`. See [`docs/evaluation.md`](docs/evaluation.md#relbench-relational-tasks)
for details, including the current RelBench submission status.

## Performance (inference speedups)

The speedups below are **on by default** and **deterministic** — identical results
run-to-run with the same settings — and the published [Results](#results) were
produced with them on. The **KV cache** is **R²-equivalent** to the un-cached path,
not bit-identical: the two paths reduce in a different order, so predictions differ by
mixed-precision noise (max abs diff ~3e-3, measured below) at identical R². The
**preprocessing speedups** are **R²-neutral**:
toggling them shifts individual predictions by a tiny, R²-equivalent amount (below
cross-environment noise), not bit-for-bit. For the exact un-accelerated path, set
each to its off value (see below). **Pipeline batching** likewise preserves the
ensemble math but can reassociate mixed-precision GEMMs at the last few bits.

| Env var | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `SYNTHEFY_GPU_SVD` | `1` (on) | Run the high-dimensional feature SVD on the GPU (exact, not randomized). Acts when features ≥256; set `0` for the CPU/randomized path. |

On tables with more than 256 features the SVD projection is fitted on the context **and** the query rows' features (labels are never used) since 0.21.0 — `"fit_on_test": true` in the bundled inference config. This keeps query rows whose features drift outside the context's range (a later time period, another instrument batch) inside the fitted subspace; on random splits the two fits coincide. Set it to `false` in a custom `inference_config` to recover the context-only fit.
| `SYNTHEFY_CAP_QUANTILES` | `1` (on) | Cap quantile-transform resolution + subsample its fit. Acts on large context (>2000 rows); set `0` to disable. |
| `SYNTHEFY_QUANTILE_MAX` / `SYNTHEFY_QUANTILE_SUBSAMPLE` | — | Tune the cap above (max quantiles / fit-subsample size). |
| `SYNTHEFY_ADAPTIVE_FIT_SUBSAMPLE` | `2000` | Fit preprocessing on at most this many rows, apply to all rows. Acts on large context; set `0` to fit on all rows. |
| `SYNTHEFY_ENABLE_CACHED_INFERENCE` | `1` (on) | Reuse the train-side attention K/V across test chunks (KV cache); ~2-3x faster on large test sets that chunk. Set `0` to disable (or `SYNTHEFY_DISABLE_CACHED_INFERENCE=1`). |
| `SYNTHEFY_DISABLE_PIPELINE_BATCHING` | `0` (batching on) | Set `1` to run preprocessing-ensemble model calls one at a time. Batching groups up to four same-shaped members when each has at most 256 processed features. |
| `SYNTHEFY_EXACT_CACHED_CUDAGRAPHS` | `0` (off) | Set `1` for exact B=1 resident-cache inference accelerated by eager CUDA-graph replay. This disables pipeline batching, requires CUDA plus `setuptools`, and safely falls back to eager B=1 when unavailable. |
| `SYNTHEFY_MAX_ELEMENTS_BUDGET` | VRAM-aware | Inference element budget; raise on large GPUs for full-context inference. Prefer `memory_policy={"elements_budget": N}`. |

### Serving memory on large tables

Nori does in-context regression: your table is *input*, not weights. So one `predict`
call keeps a per-layer key/value cache over every context row, and that cache — not the
model — is what runs you out of GPU memory on a big table.

`memory_policy=` decides what to do about it. Omit it and you get the defaults, which handle
the common cases:

```python
from synthefy_nori import NoriRegressor, MemoryPolicy

NoriRegressor(model="nori-6m")                                  # default memory policy
NoriRegressor(model="nori-6m", memory_policy="exact")                   # never quantize
NoriRegressor(model="nori-6m", memory_policy="max_context")             # fit the biggest table
NoriRegressor(model="nori-6m", memory_policy="off")                     # no cache at all
NoriRegressor(model="nori-6m", memory_policy={"gpu_budget_frac": 0.25}) # e.g. from a config file
NoriRegressor(model="nori-6m", memory_policy={"stream_context": True})  # bounded GPU staging
```

The ordinary policy walks a ladder using the cheapest rung that can serve the request;
explicit streaming reports its own `stream_*` path:

| rung | what it does | exact? |
|---|---|---|
| `resident_bf16` | cache fits VRAM at full precision | **yes** |
| `resident_int8` | quantize to stay on the GPU instead of streaming | ~6e-6 R² |
| `offload_int8` | cache lives in host RAM, streamed per layer | quantized |
| `stream_bf16` | explicitly keep context/KV on the host and stage bounded row slices | numerically close |
| `stream_int8` | the same bounded host-only path with quantized K/V | quantized |
| `context_row_chunk` | after an OOM: also cap rows per build step | **yes** |
| `plain_loop` | no cache; several times slower, may drop context rows | **yes** |

**Only the int8 rungs quantize the cache, and `resident_int8` is only reached when full
precision would not fit.** Explicit streaming is also not bit-exact, even at BF16,
because chunked GEMMs and FP32 online attention change reduction order. A small CUDA
comparison measured max prediction delta 2.93e-3 and mean delta 7.44e-4. Use
`memory_policy="exact"` to forbid quantizing on the ordinary adaptive ladder.

Budgets are **fractions of your hardware**, so one setting travels from a laptop GPU to
an H200:

| field | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `gpu_budget_frac` | `0.4` | share of total VRAM the resident cache may use |
| `host_budget_frac` | `0.25` | share of total RAM an offloaded cache may use |
| `gpu_budget_absolute_gb` / `host_budget_absolute_gb` | — | hard caps, for a shared GPU |
| `reuse_context_cache` | `True` | retain an unchanged encoded context across separate local `predict()` calls; set `False` to rebuild each call while keeping the normal within-request K/V cache. Retention is bounded: on a CUDA device the retained contexts may use up to a quarter of total VRAM, and a single context larger than that is rebuilt each call rather than kept |
| `cache_dtype` | `"bf16"` | precision the cache **starts** at |
| `allow_quantization` | `True` | may bf16 drop to int8 to stay resident? |
| `offload_to_host` | `True` | may the cache move to host RAM? |
| `stream_context` | `False` | explicitly keep full context/KV state on the host and bound GPU staging; resolves to `stream_bf16` or `stream_int8` |
| `context_row_chunk` | `None` | cap context rows per build step (auto after an OOM) |
| `elements_budget` | auto | per-forward element cap; drives chunking + subsampling |
| `allow_subsample` | `True` | may context rows be dropped to fit? `False` = raise |

Set `memory_policy={"stream_context": True}` when context-attention GPU memory should
stop scaling with context length. Streaming forces the cache onto the host, disables
cross-call context reuse, and resolves an omitted `context_row_chunk` from accelerator
VRAM: **2048** rows below 40 GiB, **8192** rows from 40 GiB, and **16384** rows from
80 GiB. An explicit value is preserved. The selected number is a maximum staged-row
cap, not an exact internal block width: runtime may split K/V blocks smaller to stay
within its attention workspace. After any larger resolved first attempt, fit-time OOMs
retry the bounded **2048 → 1024 → 512 → 256** row ladder. This is still constant GPU
memory with respect to total context length because the hardware
tier does not grow with the dataset. The full context must fit the configured host
budget. If it does not, Nori raises instead of silently falling back to `plain_loop` or
dropping the requested mechanism.

> **Ordinary adaptive host offload needs RAM > 1.6 × VRAM at these defaults.**
> Offload only engages once
> the cache exceeds the GPU budget, and it can only succeed within the host budget — so
> `0.25 × RAM` has to exceed `0.4 × VRAM`. Below that ratio the offload rung is
> unreachable and a spilling request goes straight to `plain_loop`. Concretely, a 143 GB
> H200 needs more than ~229 GB of RAM; an 80 GB card needs more than ~128 GB. If your
> box is under the ratio, raise `host_budget_frac` (Nori warns, naming this, the first
> time a request actually needs the fallback and cannot get it).
>
> The default is deliberately conservative rather than higher: the fraction is of
> *total* RAM, your own input table is already resident in it, and overshooting host RAM
> gets the process OOM-killed by the kernel — unlike overshooting VRAM, which raises a
> catchable error and degrades to the next rung.

**Which rung ran** is on the estimator after `predict`:

```python
model.predict(X_test)
model.memory_report_
# {'rung': 'resident_bf16', 'cache_dtype': 'bf16', 'est_cache_gb': 30.5,
#  'gpu_budget_absolute_gb': 57.2, 'dropped_context_rows': 0, ...}
MemoryPolicy(**model.memory_report_).is_bit_exact      # -> True
```

Fallbacks are logged (`logging.getLogger("synthefy_nori.inference.predictor")`), and
dropping to `plain_loop` also emits a `RuntimeWarning` — it is the one rung that may
subsample your context, which otherwise looks like an unexplained accuracy loss.

**Incoherent settings fail instead of being ignored.** Asking for something that cannot
take effect raises rather than silently doing nothing:

```python
model = NoriRegressor(model="nori-6m", memory_policy={"cache": False, "context_row_chunk": 2048})
model.fit(X, y)
# ValidationError: ... 'row chunking without KV caching' is not a reachable
# configuration.  (the chunk caps the K/V *build*; with no cache there is no build)
```

The check runs in `fit`, not `__init__` — scikit-learn requires `__init__` to store
parameters verbatim so `clone` works — but it does run before any inference, so a bad
config fails in seconds rather than minutes into a job.

Settings that are merely redundant warn instead — e.g. setting both a fraction and an
absolute budget tells you the fraction is ignored, rather than refusing a layered
config. Unknown keys always raise.

Local fit-once/predict-many estimators reuse an unchanged encoded context by default. To
make a local process discard context-derived state after every prediction, use the typed
configuration `memory_policy={"reuse_context_cache": False}`. All shared serving targets
(Baseten, SageMaker/AWS Marketplace, Snowflake, and custom adapters using the shared
engine) enforce that value automatically, because one replica may handle multiple people
or workloads. This does **not** disable the K/V cache within a request; it only prevents
retaining it for a later request.

Reuse is also bounded by size, which matters on wide tables. A retained context is roughly
`nlayers × n_feature_groups × n_context` — modest on a typical table, but tens of GiB once a
table has hundreds of columns, and the default regression path retains one per member of its
8-member preprocessing ensemble. Retained contexts are therefore capped at a quarter of total
accelerator memory, oldest evicted first, and a single context that exceeds that cap on its
own is rebuilt each call instead of kept. Reuse is an optimization; leaving most of the
device free for the forward pass is what keeps a large context from turning a slow
prediction into a failed one.
CUDA uses total device memory for the cap; Apple MPS uses Metal's recommended maximum
working-set size. Devices without accelerator memory to exhaust (CPU) are not capped.

**Known limit:** at large row counts × many columns, the first thing to run out of
memory is the transductive preprocessing (RBF + polynomial expansion over the whole
table), *upstream* of the transformer. None of the above helps with that.

### Choosing the context on a large table (`large_context_policy=`)

Everything above is about making a context *fit*. When the table is far larger than the
window, the more interesting question is **which rows** should be in it. By default that
choice is made by memory pressure: the context is trimmed at random to fit the element
budget, and you get a `ContextSubsampledWarning`. That is one arbitrary window, arrived
at by accident.

`large_context_policy=` makes it a decision. Above `large_context_threshold` rows (default
**50,000**), a *policy* picks the shared context and chains the calls:

```python
NoriRegressor(model="nori-6m", large_context_policy="cluster_route")   # threshold 50_000
```

| policy | Nori calls | measured vs one random window | use it when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cluster_route` (**default**) | `groups`, default 8 | **+0.017 mean R², worst case 0.000** over 15 tables of 47k–1M rows; best on 7 | you want the evidence-backed default |
| `cluster_route_g4` | 4 | +0.027 mean, worst 0.000, but on a 9-table subset | cheaper, and coarse routing suits your table |
| `safeboost` | one per shard | +0.015 mean, worst **0.000** — on 8 tables | the table is heterogeneous and you can afford the calls |
| `boost` | one per shard | −0.019 mean, worst **−0.229** | never as a default; only gated or after measuring your own table |
| `random` | 1 | the baseline | you want today's behavior, made explicit |
| `target_rank[cap=N]` | 1 | 64k−32k: −0.0035 overall; +0.0040 IID, −0.0129 LaDe | compare context caps behind a holdout gate |

Pass a **list** to gate: candidates are scored on a train holdout and the per-table
winner is deployed. This is the only safe way to use `boost` — the gate declined it on
exactly the tables where it detonated:

```python
NoriRegressor(large_context_policy=["random", "cluster_route", "safeboost"])
```

For chronologically ordered rows, use a tail holdout so future rows never enter
the candidate contexts. The measured 64k regression was concentrated in temporal
LaDe tables, so do not use the default random holdout for this comparison:

```python
NoriRegressor(
    large_context_policy=[
        "target_rank[cap=32768]",
        "target_rank[cap=65536]",
    ],
    large_context_holdout="tail",
)
```

For IID rows, leave `large_context_holdout="random"`. A cap is a maximum: when
the table is only slightly larger than the 50k activation threshold, the gate
scores a candidate on the largest context left after its holdout rather than
failing because 64k rows are unavailable.

The direct 32k and 64k arms are measured. Tail-gate selection itself is a new
safety mechanism and still needs a frozen temporal replay before it should
become a default policy.

Also accepted: `True` (the default policy), `"cluster_route[groups=16]"` to pass
parameters, and `"pkg.mod:fn"` / `"path/to/file.py:fn"` / any callable for your own —
see `synthefy_nori.inference.policies` for the `(problem, rng) -> ndarray` contract.

After a `predict`, `large_context_report_` says what actually ran: the policy, the window, the
shard count available, `nori_calls`, the gate's winner, and `reused_train_state` —
whether this call read train-derived work an earlier one had already done. Train-derived
work (the imputed train view, a boosting chain's residuals, a gate's chosen winner) is
computed once per `fit` and reused by later `predict` calls; a policy that rotates
between several pools also wants `large_context_cache_entries=8`, which costs one K/V cache
per entry and so is not raised for you.

Two per-call inputs correctly cost a re-derivation rather than being reused, so
`reused_train_state` reads `False` after either changes:

- **`output_type=`.** A chain's residual labels are relative to what the model said, so
  a chain built under `"mean"` is not the chain `"median"` would have built. Each decode
  gets its own, derived once. Alternating between them per call pays for both.
- **`memory_policy=`.** Decision caches are scoped to the full policy because lossy
  INT8 precision can change residual labels and gate scores. The element budget is also
  resolved on every call; if it changes the context window, the window-sized Problem
  and its chains are rebuilt.

Two honest caveats. These numbers are a **within-checkpoint policy comparison** on 15
tables, not a promise about yours. Every policy except `random` multiplies the forward
passes per `predict`, `safeboost`/`boost` most of all (one call per shard). It is
opt-in for both reasons: `large_context_policy=None` (the default) leaves behavior exactly
as it was.

### Silent degradation

Some fallbacks keep inference alive by handing the model **less than the configured
pipeline promised**, then returning predictions anyway. In serving that is the right
trade — a slightly worse answer beats an exception. In anything *scored* it is the wrong
one: the run produces a plausible number that reads as "this config is weak" rather than
"the pipeline broke", and nothing downstream can tell the two apart.

So none of them are silent. Each warns under its own category, and escalating the
category is how you forbid it:

| warning | raised when | prevented outright by |
|---|---|---|
| `DegradedPipelineWarning` | base class — catch it to mean "any fidelity I did not ask for" | — |
| ↳ `SvdFallbackWarning` | the high-dimensional feature SVD failed, so the model got the **raw** unprojected columns (a `fit` failure) or a **single all-zero column** (a `transform` failure) | — |
| ↳ `ContextSubsampledWarning` | context rows were **dropped** to fit the element budget | `memory_policy={"allow_subsample": False}` |

```python
from synthefy_nori import NoriRegressor, SvdFallbackWarning, strict_pipeline

model = NoriRegressor(model="nori-6m")
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

model.predict(X_test)                     # serving: keep answering, warn if degraded

with strict_pipeline():                   # scored runs: a degraded pipeline raises
    model.predict(X_test)                 # instead of reporting a number

with strict_pipeline(SvdFallbackWarning):  # or just one fallback
    model.predict(X_test)
```

`strict_pipeline()` restores the previous filters on exit, so one strict prediction does
not harden the next one — safe inside a loop over datasets. It is a thin wrapper over
`warnings.simplefilter("error", DegradedPipelineWarning)`, so `-W error::...`,
`PYTHONWARNINGS`, and a `filterwarnings` line in `pytest.ini` work too.

Because the categories form a tree, escalation is inherited: a new fallback adds one
subclass and every caller who already asked for a strict pipeline gets it. **The eval
runner (`synthefy_nori.evaluation`) already wraps every scored predict call in
`strict_pipeline(SvdFallbackWarning)`** — a broken SVD is recorded as a failed row
rather than scored. It deliberately does not escalate `ContextSubsampledWarning`, since
trimming context to a budget is expected on large tables.

Only an SVD inference config can raise `SvdFallbackWarning` at all — the bundled default
and its lower-rank eval variant do; elsewhere the step is a no-op.

### Preprocessing speedups (on by default)

`SYNTHEFY_GPU_SVD`, `SYNTHEFY_CAP_QUANTILES`, and `SYNTHEFY_ADAPTIVE_FIT_SUBSAMPLE`
accelerate the inductive preprocessing pipeline (fit on train, apply to test) and
are enabled by default. They only act on the data shapes named above — most small tables (≤1000 rows,
<256 features) see little or no change. In an internal regression benchmark on a
single H200 they cut end-to-end wall-clock by roughly 1.8× with
mean R² unchanged (0.8087 → 0.8089). A large-scale A/B restricted to the tables
where they actually engage (n>5000) measured a mean ΔR² of +0.00002 (max |Δ|
0.0004) — within run-to-run noise.

### Preprocessing-ensemble batching (on by default)

The default eight-member ensemble produces two natural groups of four members
with identical model-input shapes. Nori now runs each group as one model batch,
then restores configured member order and averages the full decoder outputs just
as the one-at-a-time path does. It applies only to ordinary regression with a
resident full-precision cache (or no cache), deterministic eval-mode models, and
at most 256 processed features per member. Retrieval, imputation, DDP, dropout,
int8/offloaded caches, wide tables, and memory-heavy requests stay on the existing
one-at-a-time path. A CUDA OOM or unsupported output shape also retries the whole
call there.

On one H200 with the public 6M model, 512 context rows, 48 raw features, and the
shipped eight-member config, batching reduced hot point-prediction latency from
1.28 s to 0.80 s without a cache (1.59×), and from 0.88 s to 0.53 s with a reused
resident cache (1.65×). The maximum point and full 999-quantile-bank differences
versus one-at-a-time fp16 execution were both 1.90e-3. Peak VRAM rose by 0.74 GiB
without a cache and 0.26 GiB with a
resident cache on that workload. Set `SYNTHEFY_DISABLE_PIPELINE_BATCHING=1` for
the legacy execution order or exact debugging comparisons.

For fit-once/serve-many workloads that require bit-exact B=1 predictions, set
`SYNTHEFY_EXACT_CACHED_CUDAGRAPHS=1`. This keeps all eight ensemble members at
B=1 but captures the cached encoder-layer eager kernels and replays them without
Python launch overhead. On the public 100M model (512 context rows, 600 query
rows, 48 raw features), hot-cache latency fell from 2.81 s to 1.53 s (1.83×),
with bit-exact point predictions and all 999 quantiles. Current B=4 execution was
1.38 s on the same workload, so exact mode recovered most of its throughput.
In separate processes, exact B=1 peaked at 12.63 GiB allocated versus 13.37 GiB
for B=4. If the resident cache is not selected, this mode remains exact eager B=1
rather than applying CUDA graphs to the ordinary forward.
CUDA-graph setup is shape-specific and took a few seconds in this benchmark;
use it for repeated resident-cache queries, not one-shot or rapidly changing
table shapes.

### KV caching (on by default)

The cached prediction path is **enabled by default**. It projects the train-side
sequence-attention keys/values **once** and streams the test rows through the
layers reusing that cache, instead of recomputing the train K/V for every test
chunk — measured **~2-3x faster** on multi-chunk inference (the win scales with
the number of chunks). It only activates when the test set is large enough that
inference is already chunking (`n_test > chunk_size`), so it does not change the
chunking and therefore does not change R². We verified `cache == chunked` directly:
identical R², with per-prediction differences at mixed-precision scale (the two paths
reduce in a different order). When the cache will not fit VRAM it is **offloaded to
host RAM or quantized rather than skipped** — see
[Serving memory on large tables](#serving-memory-on-large-tables). Disable it with
`SYNTHEFY_ENABLE_CACHED_INFERENCE=0` or the `SYNTHEFY_DISABLE_CACHED_INFERENCE=1`
kill switch, or `memory_policy={"cache": False}`.

On the 1024-feature QSAR-TID-11 set (single H200), `predict` wall-clock vs.
test-set size with the cache OFF vs. ON shows the OFF time grows linearly
with the chunk count while the ON time stays roughly flat, reaching a **2.57×**
speedup on the full 1723-row test set (10.7 s vs. 27.4 s; ~1.3–1.9× at smaller
sizes). Predictions are effectively identical (max abs diff ~1.5e-3, attributable
to fp16 mixed precision — the cached path is mathematically equivalent). The cache
engages automatically whenever inference already chunks (`n_test > chunk_size`),
which happens readily on many-feature tables or large test sets (here forced via
`SYNTHEFY_MAX_ELEMENTS_BUDGET=1050000`, driving `chunk_size` to its 256-row floor →
7 chunks).

Reproduce (prints the results table and writes `benchmarks/plots/kv_cache_speed.png`):
`uv run python benchmarks/bench_kv_cache.py`

```bash
# All speedups (preprocessing + KV cache) are on by default — nothing to enable.

# To disable them all (e.g. for exact reproducibility / debugging):
SYNTHEFY_GPU_SVD=0 SYNTHEFY_CAP_QUANTILES=0 SYNTHEFY_ADAPTIVE_FIT_SUBSAMPLE=0 \
SYNTHEFY_ENABLE_CACHED_INFERENCE=0 SYNTHEFY_DISABLE_PIPELINE_BATCHING=1 \
python your_inference_script.py
```

## Training

Smoke test (2 steps, single GPU, no logging):

```bash
TOTAL_STEPS=2 NPROC_PER_NODE=1 WANDB_MODE=disabled bash scripts/train.sh
```

Training runs entirely on synthetic data and **trains to completion**: there is
no real-data validation in the loop, so no benchmark data needs to
be downloaded to train, and no eval signal influences checkpoint selection. Each
run writes periodic and final checkpoints, and each curriculum tier seeds from
the previous tier's final checkpoint.

### Tier 1: from scratch

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 bash scripts/train.sh
```

Configurable via environment variables (`TOTAL_STEPS`, `LR`, `BATCH_SIZE`,
`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, ...; see the script header). Checkpoints land in
`checkpoints/<run>/tier1/`.

### Tiers 2 to 5: curriculum continuation

One script runs the rest of the curriculum, each tier seeding from the previous
tier's final checkpoint:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 bash scripts/continue_training.sh
```

| Tier | Table shapes (N x F) | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | N ≤ 4K, F ≤ 384 | larger tables |
| 3 | N ≤ 8K, F ≤ 768 | largest tables |
| 4 | N ≤ 56K, F ≤ 96 | large-N / long-context specialist |
| 5 | N ≤ 33K, F ≤ 1280 | both-large corner (N and F coupled by a cell budget) |

It auto-detects the most recent tier-1 run, or point it at one with
`RUN_ROOT=checkpoints/<run>`. Run a subset with `START_TIER` / `END_TIER`
(e.g. `END_TIER=3` for tiers 2 to 3 only).

> **Tiers 4 and 5 push N up to 56K rows.** Dense O(N²) sample attention at that
> scale forces `batch=1` with large gradient accumulation, and can OOM or hang
> depending on GPU memory. Smoke-probe them first; see the script header.

Training uses the **Muon** optimizer (EMA 0.999), a **pinball** loss with 999
quantiles + a monotonicity penalty, and bf16 mixed precision with DDP. Pass
`--seed` for reproducible runs.

### Training acceleration

The bundled launchers enable native RMSNorm, foreach EMA updates, and regional
dynamic `torch.compile` by default. These preserve the natural shape curriculum;
disable them per run with `NATIVE_RMS_NORM=0`, `EMA_FOREACH=0`, or
`COMPILE_ENCODER_LAYERS=none`. Exact static-shape compilation is also available,
but requires an explicit shape palette that changes the curriculum and must be
validated separately.

See [docs/training.md](docs/training.md) for the full training options and
[the acceleration guide](docs/training_static_compile.md) for compiler modes,
cache setup, measurements, and reproducibility controls.
