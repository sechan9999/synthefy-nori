"""Shared-pool inference policies for large-context Nori, and the API to add your own.

A **policy** answers one question: given a table far larger than Nori's context
window, which rows go in the shared context, and how are the calls chained? Every
policy uses one context shared across queries, never a per-query context. That keeps
the K/V cache reusable across all queries in a call and preserves the predictor's
cached regression path.

This module is the **shared** home for that logic:
`NoriRegressor(large_context_policy=...)` runs these policies on the inference path (see
`synthefy_nori.inference.large_context`), and the benchmark harness imports from here too.
Keeping one implementation for both roles prevents benchmark and production behavior
from drifting apart: a policy measured in the harness is the exact policy that
deploys.

Six policies are registered. `cluster_route` is the only one with full benchmark
coverage and is the default when the feature is enabled; the rest are opt-in. The
numbers below are from the recorded within-checkpoint policy benchmark:

  random             one random window. The baseline, and the cheapest thing that works:
                     a shared 8k window is within 0.013 R² of full context (median 0.004).
  target_rank        one target-stratified window, selected at equal-frequency rank
                     midpoints. ``cap=`` may make it smaller than the hardware window,
                     so a holdout gate can compare 32k with 64k on the same fitted table.
                     At 64k versus 32k it lost -0.0035 mean R² over nine extreme tables,
                     including -0.0129 on all four LaDe tables, at 3.02x latency. It is
                     a gateable specialist, not a default.
  cluster_route      cluster the QUERIES into `groups` groups, build one shared local pool
                     per group, route each query to its group's cache. Best policy of the
                     nine benchmarked (+0.017 mean Δ vs `random`, best on 7 of 15 tables,
                     never regresses) at `groups` cache builds instead of one. THE DEFAULT.
  cluster_route_g4   `cluster_route` at groups=4. Best mean of the sweep (+0.027) but on
                     the 9-table subset only, and 4 cache builds instead of 8.
  safeboost          residual boosting whose corrections are applied only when they do
                     not hurt out-of-fold R² on the next shard. +0.0146 mean Δ, min Δ
                     0.000 — it keeps boost's upside with no disaster tail — but was
                     measured on 8 of the 15 tables only, so it is opt-in, not default.
  boost              plain residual boosting over successive context shards.
                     **Measured at −0.019 mean Δ and −0.229 min Δ**: bimodal, 5 wins and
                     2 detonations (diamonds 0.946→0.717, BNG(stock) 0.806→0.605). It is
                     registered so the comparison is runnable, NOT because it is
                     deployable — prefer `safeboost`, which dominates it, or gate it.

Both boosting arms shard the table into `n_train // window` disjoint shards. Their
observed failures were at 4–6 shards, so they warn below `MIN_BOOST_SHARDS` (8) and
fall back to `random` below two.

Other evaluated approaches (feature-diversity coresets and per-cluster boosting)
either lost or had severe regressions and are deliberately not shipped. Target-rank
selection is the exception: it is shipped opt-in so its exact 32k/64k variants can be
compared inside the existing train-holdout gate, not because its global 64k result won.
Use this module's extension point to evaluate other approaches without expanding the
built-in menu.

## Writing your own policy

A policy is any callable `(problem, rng) -> np.ndarray` of length `problem.n_test`.
`Problem` gives you the arrays plus the one primitive a policy is allowed to call:

    from synthefy_nori.inference.policies import register_policy

    @register_policy("bag")
    def bag(problem, rng, k=3):
        \"\"\"Average k independent random windows — the cheapest variance reducer.\"\"\"
        windows = [rng.permutation(problem.n_train)[: problem.window] for _ in range(k)]
        return np.mean([problem.predict(w) for w in windows], axis=0)  # k Nori calls

Registration is optional. `NoriRegressor(large_context_policy=...)` also takes a dotted
module path, file path, or callable, so nothing here needs editing to run your own
idea:

    NoriRegressor(large_context_policy="my_policies.py:bag")
    NoriRegressor(large_context_policy="mypkg.mod:my_policy[k=3]")

`Problem.predict(context_idx, query_idx)` chunks huge query blocks and (when
`impute=True`) median-imputes from the context rows as the eval harness does, so a
policy stays about row selection. `Problem.predict_arrays` is the escape hatch for
policies that need synthetic labels (residual boosting) or want to query train rows.

Imputation is a constructor flag because the two callers differ: the benchmark harness
imputes here to match `evaluation.harness._apply_impute`, while the production path
passes `impute=False` — `NoriPredictor` owns missing-value handling there, and imputing
first would change what the model sees relative to an ordinary `predict`.

    Carves up to `holdout` rows out of train, scores every candidate on them, then
    re-runs the winner on the real test set. ``strategy="random"`` is the ordinary
    IID split. ``strategy="tail"`` holds out the final rows and is the leak-safe choice
    when input order is chronological. This is how a custom policy
    earns its way into production without a global claim: on the 15-table run the gate scored +0.0166,
    matching the best single policy, because it deployed the strong arm where it won
    and fell back where it would have blown up (diamonds: 0.947 not 0.717).

    Cost is the whole menu PLUS the winner run again — the winner is evaluated twice, once
    on the holdout and once for real. `nori_calls` prices this correctly (a subproblem
    bills its parent), so a gate over 3 arms reads ~2x the winner's own cost.

    The subproblem keeps the parent's `window` on purpose: the gate has to score the exact
    policy configuration it will deploy, and shrinking the window would estimate a
    different policy. The cost is that on a table whose regions are already thinner than
    `window`, routing policies hit their backfill path during gating and their candidate
    pools overlap more than they will at deploy time — the gate is conservative there,
    not wrong.

    The winner is recorded on the returned function as `.last_winner`.
