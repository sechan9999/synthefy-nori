"""How much memory inference may use, and where the K/V cache lives.

Nori does in-context regression: the context table is *input*, not weights, so one
``predict`` call reads all N context rows and keeps a per-layer key/value cache that
every query row then attends to. That cache is O(nlayers x N) and stays resident for
the whole decode phase, which makes it the dominant serving cost at large N.

:class:`MemoryPolicy` is the single object describing what to do about that.
:meth:`MemoryPolicy.resolve` measures the request and returns **another
MemoryPolicy** with the decided fields concrete — same type in, same type out, so
there is no second "decision" type to keep straight.

Every field's declared default is its **real value**, not a sentinel: reading the
signature tells you what happens without looking anything up. The adaptive part is
expressed as *permissions* (``allow_quantization``, ``offload_to_host``) rather than
an opaque ``"auto"``, so "what is the default precision" and "may it change under
pressure" are two separate, individually readable questions.

The ladder, cheapest rung first. Each rung is used only when the one above it cannot
serve the request:

=================  ========================================================
rung               meaning
=================  ========================================================
no_cache           the cached path does not apply (e.g. the query set is small
                   enough that inference never chunks). Not a degradation.
resident_bf16      the full-precision cache fits the GPU budget. The unchunked
                   cached execution is the reference for exactness below.
resident_int8      bf16 would not fit but int8 does, so the cache stays on the
                   fast on-GPU path instead of paying PCIe streaming. Costs
                   |dR2| ~ 6e-6 (per-(row, head) absmax quantization).
                   Requires ``allow_quantization``.
offload_bf16       cannot stay resident (or resident attempts OOM) -> the
                   full-precision cache lives in host RAM. Bit-identical to the
                   same resident cached execution with unchanged computation;
                   slower;
                   may follow resident_int8 to recover precision while moving host-side.
offload_int8       cannot stay resident at any precision -> quantized cache in
                   host RAM, each layer's slice streamed back on demand.
stream_bf16        caller-requested bounded streaming: context activations and
                   K/V stay in host RAM while at most ``context_row_chunk`` rows
                   are staged on the GPU. Never falls through to ``plain_loop``.
                   Not bit-exact because online attention changes reduction order.
stream_int8        the same bounded host-only path with an int8 K/V cache.
context_row_chunk  an actual OOM happened -> re-run bounding the prefill
                   working set too (deterministic, with small floating-point
                   reassociation differences; see layer.py).
plain_loop         nothing above worked. **No cache at all: every query chunk
                   recomputes the context K/V, so this is several times slower,
                   and if the context alone exceeds the element budget the
                   caller must SUBSAMPLE it — silently losing rows unless
                   ``allow_subsample=False`` turns that into an error.** The
                   predictor logs a warning naming the rung and, when rows are
                   dropped, how many.
=================  ========================================================

**Only the int8 rungs quantize the cache.** The explicitly requested streaming rungs
are also not bit-exact, including ``stream_bf16``, because bounded online attention
reassociates floating-point reductions. The measured CUDA difference for BF16 streaming
is small rather than zero (max prediction delta 2.93e-3, mean 7.44e-4). Outside
streaming, ``resident_int8`` is reached only when the full-precision cache does not fit.
Lossless cache storage does not guarantee bit-identical predictions across
execution paths. Row chunking, query chunk changes, ensemble batching, streaming
and uncached execution can change floating-point rounding. The ``exact`` preset disables
quantization; it does not freeze those execution choices or prevent subsampling.

Outside explicit ``stream_context=True``, ``context_row_chunk`` and ``plain_loop`` are
*reactions* to an OutOfMemoryError, so the caller escalates into them via
:meth:`MemoryPolicy.escalated`; :meth:`resolve` picks the opening rung. Streaming starts
with a concrete row cap instead and raises if its host-only contract cannot be honoured.

Budgets are **fractions of the hardware** rather than absolute GB so one setting is
portable from a 24 GB laptop card to a 143 GB H200. The ``*_absolute_gb`` overrides
exist for the one case a fraction cannot express: a co-tenanted GPU, where what
matters is a hard ceiling rather than a share.

**This module reads no environment variables.** Configuration comes from
``NoriPredictor(memory_policy=...)`` / ``NoriRegressor(memory_policy=...)``; the only env var in
the whole path is the ``SYNTHEFY_DISABLE_CACHED_INFERENCE`` kill switch, handled by
the predictor. Resolution is pure arithmetic — no torch allocations, no device calls
— so every rung boundary is unit-testable on CPU rather than only exercised by
whoever happens to run a 500k-row table on a big card.

        :meth:`coerce` is enough when the policy was written by whoever runs the
        process: a bad value is their own problem, and a warning goes to a terminal
        they are looking at. A **server** taking policies from requests needs three
        more things, and all three depend on this module's own fields — which is why
        they live here rather than in each serving target:

        1. **Bound the host-RAM budgets** (:data:`HOST_BUDGET_FIELDS`). Every other
           field spends only the requesting caller's GPU memory, so overspending is
           self-inflicted and passed through. Host RAM is different in kind:
           exceeding the container's cgroup limit is a SIGKILL, not a catchable
           error, so it takes down the replica and charges the *next* caller a cold
           start. Clamped values are returned by name so the server can report them
           instead of applying them silently.
        2. **Clamp before validating**, so the coherence rules below run against the
           numbers that will actually be used — a warning about a budget that cannot
           bite is only true of the clamped figure.
        3. **Capture the warnings for this caller.** :func:`warn_once` de-duplicates
           for the life of the process, so on a long-lived server the first caller to
           make a given mistake absorbs the only copy and everyone after them is told
           nothing — and it goes to the server's log either way, never to the person
           who could act on it. The registry is cleared and the warnings collected
           per call, for the server to return in its response.

        Args:
            value: what the request carried, unchanged. ``None`` means the request
                said nothing, and is returned as ``None`` rather than as the default
                policy, so a server can tell "not asked for" from "asked for the
                defaults" and keep its response unchanged in the first case.
            max_host_budget_frac: the largest share of host RAM this deployment will
                grant. A deployment-shaped decision (it depends on what else lives in
                the container), so it has no default here.
            min_context_row_chunk: the smallest prefill step this deployment will run.
                ``None`` leaves it unbounded, which is right in-process and wrong on a
                shared server: a tiny value costs TIME rather than memory, and it spends
                that time holding the inference lock. Also deployment-shaped, hence no
                default.
            total_ram_gb: host RAM to size an absolute budget against.
                ``None`` measures it with :func:`total_host_ram_gb`, which is
                cgroup-aware — a container sees its limit, not the machine's.

        Returns:
            ``(policy, clamped_field_names, notes)``. ``policy`` is None only when
            ``value`` was. ``notes`` are the coherence warnings, already formatted.

        Raises:
            ValueError, TypeError: exactly as :meth:`coerce` — the caller maps them
                onto its own status code, keeping the message, which already names
                the offending field.

        built moments earlier, so this stays callable on its own with just a
        resolved policy and fresh measurements -- exactly how the tests above use
        it, independent of any particular ``resolve()`` call. Passing
        ``bytes_per_element``/``head_dim`` that do not match the ones ``resolved``
        was actually resolved with is a caller error, not something this method
        can detect; the ``resolved.rung not in labels`` fallback below exists for
        exactly that mismatch.
