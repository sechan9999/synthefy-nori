        Ablation (96 datasets) showed unconditional YJ was net negative despite
        winning stock_fardamento02 (skew 17.7, +0.077 R²). The skew threshold
        default (10.0) preserves the wins on extreme-skew datasets while
        skipping moderately-skewed ones where YJ harms predictions.

        When return_distribution=True the YJ point ensemble is bypassed: it
        averages point predictions in original-y space and has no
        distribution-level analogue, so the distribution path returns the raw
        single-pass quantile bank.

        CHUNKS within a single call; this reuses it across separate predict() calls
        too (fit-once / serve-many), so the O(N_train) context forward runs once per
        context instead of once per query batch. It is bit-identical to rebuilding:
        the (random) feature positional embedding is drawn under the per-pipe seed
        the predictor sets before every forward, so a fresh build would draw the
        same one -- the cache only skips recomputing an identical result.

        Reuse is decided by EXACT content verification (``_same_context``), not by a
        digest. A long-lived predictor may be re-fitted with a different table, so a
        false cache hit would answer new query rows against an earlier context. That is
        a wrong-answer bug, not a slow one, so the check may not be probabilistic --
        see ``_same_context`` for why bytes are compared directly instead of using a
        summary hash.

        ``MemoryPolicy(reuse_context_cache=False)`` rebuilds on every call and clears
        any retained bundle. This is a typed policy rather than an environment knob,
        so sklearn cloning, serialized configuration, local inference and serving all
        share one explicit contract.

        ``NoriRegressor(large_context_cache_entries=K)`` retains K DISTINCT contexts per
        pipeline instead of one, most-recently-used first. Ordinary ``predict`` reuses
        a single context and wants the default of 1; a large-context policy rotates between
        several shared pools within one ``predict``
        (:mod:`synthefy_nori.inference.large_context`), and at K=1 each pool evicts the
        previous one, so a policy with 8 pools gets zero hits and pays 8 rebuilds plus
        8 verification clones. Each entry is a full K/V cache, so capacity is bounded
        only by the caller's explicit, memory-aware choice.

        Compares raw BIT PATTERNS rather than values or a digest, because both

        - ``torch.equal`` uses float equality, and NaN != NaN. Missing values are
          ordinary in a Nori context, so a value compare would miss on every
          NaN-bearing table and rebuild forever -- silently deleting the speedup.
        - a summary digest (shape/NaN-count/sum/sum-of-squares/endpoints) collides on
          trivially constructed inputs: any permutation of the interior preserves all
          of them, so two genuinely different contexts hash alike. On a false hit the
          cached bundle answers the new query rows, i.e. predictions computed against
          the WRONG context, returned as if correct. A cryptographic digest would fix
          the collision odds but still costs a full device->host copy per call, which
          a byte compare on-device does not.

        Bitwise identity has neither failure mode: NaN payloads match themselves, and
        there are no false positives at all. Its false NEGATIVES (+0.0 vs -0.0, or two
        distinct NaN payloads) merely rebuild something we could have reused, which
        costs time and never correctness.

        The ``uint8`` view works for every dtype -- 1-byte elements always divide the
        last dimension evenly -- so one path covers float32/float64/float16/bfloat16
        and the integer dtypes alike. Shape, dtype and device are checked separately
        so that two tables of equal byte length but different layout cannot match.
