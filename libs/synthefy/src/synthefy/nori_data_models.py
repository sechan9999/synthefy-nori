"""Lightweight Nori client/serving data models.

``MemoryPolicy`` mirrors the authoritative model in ``synthefy-nori``. The
large-context types below keep the client transport-neutral: local mode may forward
a Python callable, while hosted modes send a policy-name string for the server's
authoritative resolver to validate.

**This is a copy, and the original is authoritative.** The policy is defined by
``synthefy_nori.inference.memory_policy.MemoryPolicy``, in the repo that also runs the
serving code, and that model is what actually validates a request. This file exists so a
client user gets a typed, documented object without installing ``synthefy-nori`` — which
would pull torch, numpy, scikit-learn and wandb into a thin API client.

So the honest description of this file is: **duplicated on purpose, policed by CI.** A
cross-repo sync check is specced in SynthefyPFN#119 and will compare this module's
``model_json_schema()`` against the library's, on every merge to either repo. Until that
exists, ``tests/test_nori_data_models.py`` performs the same comparison wherever both
packages happen to be installed.

What is copied, and what is deliberately not:

* **Copied:** the field names, types, bounds, enums, defaults and documentation. That is
  precisely what ``model_json_schema()`` covers, which is what makes a schema comparison a
  complete check on this file rather than a partial one.
* **NOT copied:** the coherence rules (which combinations are incoherent), the fallback
  ladder, and ``resolve()``. Those live server-side and run there. Duplicating behaviour
  would add divergence a schema comparison cannot see — the client would have to be *right*,
  not merely *matching*. An incoherent policy is rejected by the server with the library's
  own message, before any inference is paid for.

Two peers, deliberately at different versions: the **hosted** path runs the internal repo's
copy of the library (serving vendors it at deploy time), while ``mode="local"`` uses whatever
``synthefy-nori`` is pip-installed from PyPI. So this mirror tracks the *wire* contract, and
local mode gates separately on what is installed — see ``_local_memory_policy_available``.

    ``MemoryPolicy`` and pass it. It is a different class with the same name, so pydantic
    refuses it — and the message it produces ("input should be an instance of MemoryPolicy")
    is actively misleading to someone who is holding exactly that. Dump it to a dict and let
    normal validation take over.

    ``exclude_unset`` so only the fields that caller actually set survive: the server (or the
    library, in local mode) then applies its own defaults to the rest, instead of this client
    freezing whatever the defaults happened to be when it was installed.

    A BeforeValidator rather than a helper called from ``predict()``: attached to the type it
    applies on construction, on assignment, and anywhere the annotation is reused — there is no
    call site to forget.
